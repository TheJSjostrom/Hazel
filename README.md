# Hazel 1 Hour Game

This is a quick little game made in a couple of hours to test out the current state of [Hazel](https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel).<br/>Check out the video here: https://youtu.be/qITIvVV6BHk

## Notes
Tested in Debug and Release. Open `Hazel.sln` and run the `Sandbox` project. Alternatively you can run `scripts/Win-GenProjects.bat` to generate new project files. The current commit is an _exact_ submission of what I achieved within the video timeframe. I may modify this in the future to make it a little more polished, as well as provide a debrief of my experiences and what I think should be prioritized for Hazel's future development.

Hazel is primarily an early-stage interactive application and rendering engine for Windows. Currently not much is implemented, however (almost) everything inside this repository is being created within YouTube videos, found at [thecherno.com/engine](https://thecherno.com/engine).
